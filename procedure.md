## Demo
* On the experiment panel you will see a graph, a stack and 2 tabs denoting whether the DFS 1 or DFS 2 is running.
* The graph will a directed graph. The nodes will be numbered from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
* The stack will be empty initially. It will be used to show the order in which the nodes are visited in the DFS.
### Observation
* While the DFS 1 is running try to see the order in which the nodes are visited, and how the stack is updated.
* After DFS 1 is completed, the order of the edges in the graph will be reversed.
* Now try to see how the components are coloured in DFS 2.

## Practice
* The practice part is quite similar to the demo. As you progress, you will encounter questions that require answers to proceed.

## Exercise
* On the experiment panel you will see only a graph.
* By clicking on a node, you can change the color.
* The node can be colored with the following colors green, violet, orange, blue, yellow, brown,black, grey.
* Clicking on a node once will turn it green; clicking on it again will change its color to violet, and so on. If you click on a node with a grey color, it will turn green.
* The task is to give each component a unique color.

### Observation
* The observation panel will show if the answer is correct or not.
