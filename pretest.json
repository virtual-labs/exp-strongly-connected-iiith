      "answers": {
        "a": "BFS",
        "b": "DFS",
        "c": "Both BFS and DFS",
        "d": "None of the above"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "BFS can be used to find the cycle in a directed graph but in case of undirected graph we need to do topological sorting first.",
        "b": "DFS keeps the record of visited node and also a stack."

      "question": "Q2. Allan was using DFS on a tree, he used the same code on a graph but the results were not correct. What could be the reason?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "DFS can only be used on trees",
        "b": "DFS can be used on graphs but we need to keep track of visited nodes",
        "c": "Need to use a stack in DFS"

      "explanations": {
        "b": "Graph can contain cycles, so we need to keep track of visited nodes.",
        "c": "DFS in tree uses stack implicitly (recursion call), but in graph we need to use it explicitly. Thus absence of stack is not the reason for incorrect results."

        "a": "This is the order of traversal if DFS is used. BFS will give 50134267.",
