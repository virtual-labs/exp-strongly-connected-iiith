      "explanations": {
        "a": "The algorithm is a DFS based algorithm. The first DFS takes O(n+m) time, the second DFS takes O(n+m) time and the reversing the graph also takes O(n+m) time. So total time is O(n+m)."

      "explanations": {
        "c": "The algorithm needs a stack to store the vertices in the order of their finish times. The stack can have at most n vertices. So the space complexity is O(n)."

        "a": "True",

      "explanations": {
        "b": "The algorithm can be used for both directed and undirected graphs. A normal DFS can be only used to find the strongly connected components in an undirected graph."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "Since there are no cycles in the graph, each node is a strongly connected component. So the number of strongly connected components is n."
